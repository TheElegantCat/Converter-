# Converter

I made a multi-converter (currently in beta-test) to stop having to go to sites that collect your personal data and waste your time. This project is not finished yet; it is currently a test version that you can test yourself! Feel free to give feedback, and I will update it as often as possible. I can't upload it on GitHub so there is a link for download it : https://mega.nz/file/IdYHVApJ#SRERTUsR-Q3Npuj-N2py0VlvxWMgLqJI3x6NWsXFqT8

## **About the Converter**

The Converter is a standalone executable tool designed to simplify file conversions without needing to visit potentially unsafe or privacy-invasive websites. It provides a fast, secure, and offline solution for converting various file types.

This project was created to:
- **Protect user privacy:** Avoid exposing sensitive data to online services.
- **Save time:** Eliminate the need to upload and download files for simple tasks.
- **Be self-contained:** Since the program is a `.exe`, it does not require any additional dependencies or downloads to function.

The Converter is lightweight, efficient, and easy to use, making it an excellent alternative to online tools.
